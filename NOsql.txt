I am building a simple project of frontend(website) and backend(NoSql but not MongoDB) like flipkart,Amazon etc
the backend would be my own device(choose a simple Nosql rather than MongoDB) and frontend would be a HTML+CSS+Javascript 
It may include an API(I am not sure of what API to use) that connects the backend and frontend 
Can you give the tools and setup to be made to work and run this project

backend
	Use LowDB (if you want TRUE NoSQL)
	Use SQLite (if you want stability + easier queries)
