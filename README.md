Let me explain how to run the project

Requisite(VScode, node.js(LTS) preinstalled, MongoDB Community Server installed and running)


clone the project to VScode
open two terminals
both the terminals contain the path to the backend folder
in 1 terminal type $node db-cli.js        (and press enter)
in 2 terminal type $npm run dev           (and press enter)
in terminal 1 you can insert,delete,etc add photos to images section and note the path
in terminal 2 localhost server runs
